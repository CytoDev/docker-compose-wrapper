# Docker Compose Wrapper
A "simple" drop-in container wrapper

## Notice
This repository requires **a lot** of configuration on your part. This is to be expected, seeing how this is only an attempt at wrapping docker-compose. I would advise against using this repository, but this will be a good starting point to anyone looking into containerising their applications.

## Prerequisites
Install docker via [the official docs](https://docs.docker.com/install/)  
Install docker-compose [as a python package](https://pypi.org/project/docker-compose/)  

## How to
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:CytoDev/docker-compose-wrapper.git
$ git remote rm origin
```

See the [example branch](https://github.com/CytoDev/docker-compose-wrapper/tree/example) to get a general idea on how to set this repository up in your use-case.
